# MinesweeperCPP (harmless version)
a virus that fucks up your computer with a simple game

this is a ripoff off leuraks minesweeper stuff, but its my version, it will not work under Windows 2000

this is the **harmless** version though, it will not delete regedit keys and values, it will not change desktop background and it won't cause BSODs.

with the harmless version, you can use this to prank your friends or prank other people, as long as it does not have harmful code inside of it.

this program contains _**SPAGHETTI code**_, so it will not be the best for learning.
